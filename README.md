# Flutter Starter Template

A ready-to-use Flutter boilerplate that I use as the foundation for every new project. Instead of setting up architecture, theming, caching, and navigation from scratch each time, I clone this template and start building features immediately.

## What's Included

**Architecture** — Feature-based folder structure with BLoC/Cubit + Freezed for state management, GetIt for dependency injection, and GoRouter (type-safe, code-generated) for navigation.

**Theming** — Material 3 theme system with 5 color variants, light/dark mode support, and a theme selection UI. Managed via Cubit + SharedPreferences.

**Caching** — Dual-layer cache: SharedPreferences for simple key-value data, Hive CE for complex model storage. Both wrapped with clean abstractions.

**Localization** — EasyLocalization with Turkish and English out of the box. Language switching built into the settings page.

**Asset Generation** — FlutterGen for type-safe access to images, SVGs, Lottie animations, and fonts. No more hardcoded asset paths.

**Shared Widgets & Utilities** — Reusable button components (primary, secondary, text) with haptic feedback, `AppPaddings` for consistent spacing, `AppMessenger` for SnackBar/Dialog/BottomSheet via context extensions, `RegexTypes` for common validation patterns, and responsive helpers.

**Screens** — Splash, 5-step onboarding (with completion flag), home, and settings pages — all wired up and ready.

**Documentation** — The `doc/new_feature/` directory is a built-in developer guide. It contains modular docs for every common task: creating a feature folder, adding models, services, state management, views, routes, assets, caching, and more. Each file is self-contained — read only the one you need. There's also a checklist to make sure nothing is missed when adding a new feature. See [`doc/new_feature/README.md`](doc/new_feature/README.md) for the full navigation table.
