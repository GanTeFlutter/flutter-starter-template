This file is written as instructions for Claude Code.
Follow the steps below in order. Ask the user questions and branch based on their answers.

## Step 1: Clean Old Generated Files

The cloned repo may contain old `.g.dart` and `.freezed.dart` files.
These may be incompatible with the current environment and should be deleted first.

```bash
find lib -name "*.g.dart" -delete && find lib -name "*.freezed.dart" -delete
```

---

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

If errors occur:
- Check Flutter SDK version: `flutter --version`
- Must be compatible with `environment.sdk` in `pubspec.yaml`
- If needed: `flutter pub upgrade`

---

## Step 3: Firebase Question

Ask the user:

> **Do you want to enable Firebase integration?**
> (For version checking via Firebase Remote Config)

### If YES → Go to Step 3a
### If NO → Skip to Step 4

---

## Step 3a: Activate Firebase Integration

Read the `doc/new_feature/firebase_commented_out.md` file. It describes which files have which lines
commented out. Remove all comment markers tagged with `// TODO: Firebase kurulduktan sonra`
and activate the original code.

Steps in order:

### 3a.1 — `pubspec.yaml`
Uncomment the Firebase packages:
```yaml
firebase_core: ^latest_version
firebase_remote_config: ^latest_version
```
To get latest versions, check `pub.dev` or write `any` and resolve with `flutter pub get`.

### 3a.2 — `flutter pub get`
Install the newly added Firebase packages:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3a.3 — `lib/product/service/service_locator.dart`
- Uncomment the `RemoteConfigService` import
- Uncomment the `RemoteConfigService` registration in `_registerSingletons()`
- Uncomment the `RemoteConfigService.init()` call in `_initializeServices()`
- Uncomment the `remoteConfigService` getter in `ServiceLocator` extension

### 3a.4 — `lib/feature/login_process/splash/state/splash_cubit.dart`
- Uncomment `package_info_plus` and `RemoteConfigService` imports
- Uncomment `RemoteConfigService` dependency injection in constructor
- Uncomment version check logic in `checkApp()` (remove the temporary `SplashState.success()` line)
- Uncomment the `_isVersionLessThan()` method

### 3a.5 — `lib/product/init/application_init.dart`
- Uncomment the `Firebase.initializeApp()` call

### 3a.6 — `lib/product/navigation/app_router.dart`
- Pass `locator.remoteConfigService` as a parameter when creating `SplashCubit`
- Add the required import

### Important Note
Firebase Console setup (`flutterfire configure`, `google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`)
will be done separately by the user. Only activate the code side. Since Firebase is not yet configured,
Firebase-related errors during `flutter analyze` or `flutter run` are expected — IGNORE THEM.

---

## Step 4: Regenerate Code-Gen Files

Generate Freezed, GoRouter, Hive adapter, FlutterGen, and JsonSerializable files with `build_runner`.

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

**Generated files:**

| File type | Generator |
|-----------|-----------|
| `*.freezed.dart` | Freezed (State classes) |
| `*.g.dart` | GoRouter, JsonSerializable, Hive |
| `assets.gen.dart` | FlutterGen (Asset accessors) |
| `fonts.gen.dart` | FlutterGen (Font constants) |

---

## Step 5: Generate EasyLocalization Keys

Generate the type-safe `LocaleKeys` class from translation files.

```bash
flutter pub run easy_localization:generate -O lib/product/init/language -f keys -o locale_keys.g.dart --source-dir assets/translations
```

**Input:** `assets/translations/tr.json` and `en.json`
**Output:** `lib/product/init/language/locale_keys.g.dart`

---

## Step 6: Reinstall Dependencies

For a clean dependency resolution after generated files:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

---

## Step 7: Error Analysis and Fixing

```bash
flutter analyze
```

### Rules

1. If NO errors → tell the user "Project is ready, you can run it with `flutter run`".
2. If errors exist → fix according to the table below:

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Target URI doesn't exist` (*.g.dart) | Generated file missing | Re-run Step 4 |
| `Target URI doesn't exist` (locale_keys) | EasyLocalization generate missing | Re-run Step 5 |
| `Undefined class 'Assets'` | FlutterGen file missing | Re-run Step 4 |
| `The method '...' isn't defined` | Freezed output missing | Re-run Step 4 |
| `Could not resolve...` | Package not installed | Re-run `flutter pub get` |
| Firebase-related errors | Firebase not yet configured | **IGNORE** (user will handle) |

3. After fixing non-Firebase errors, run `flutter analyze` again.
4. Repeat until clean output (excluding Firebase errors).

## Project Customization

After setup is complete, follow the customization checklist in
`doc/project.md` under the **"New Project Setup (Customization)"** section.
